# ax25lib
Python module for AX25 used in hamradio. Currently for TNC you can use Direwolf or SoundModem by UZ7HO. Example use you can see in aprs.py file.

Requirements:
Python: 2.7 (not tested on version 3)

This is initial version that understand only UI frames (used in APRS). In future i'll try to implement full AX25 stack.
